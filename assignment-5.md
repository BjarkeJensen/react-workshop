# Assignment 5: Redux Toolkit

In this assignment, we'll add the connection between React and Redux.

On the one hand we have a React component tree, on the other hand there's a
global state. These two things need to be connected to actually make sense.

Introduce *Redux Toolkit* to reorganize your state management code and to
connect the global state to your component tree.
